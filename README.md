# LangChain-Runnables

This repository provides a hands-on guide to using **Runnables in LangChain**, a powerful abstraction designed to build flexible and composable pipelines for language model applications. It contains code examples, Jupyter notebooks, and notes to help you understand and implement Runnables effectively.

## ðŸ§  Overview

**Runnables** are the core abstraction in LangChain v0.1+, replacing many previous concepts like Chains and Tools. They allow you to create modular, reusable, and composable workflows that can include LLMs, prompts, retrievers, and other logic.

This project explores:

1. **RunnableLambda** â€“ Define inline custom functions as Runnables.
2. **RunnableSequence** â€“ Chain Runnables in a sequence.
3. **RunnableParallel** â€“ Run Runnables in parallel and combine results.
4. **RunnableBranch** â€“ Conditional logic and branching.
5. **RunnablePassthrough** â€“ Passes input as-is, useful in debugging or placeholders.
